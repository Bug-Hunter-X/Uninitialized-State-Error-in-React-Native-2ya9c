The solution is to conditionally render the state variable, using it only after the component has been properly initialized.  One common approach is to check if the state is defined.  `BugSolution.js` demonstrates this solution by using a conditional statement.  The `count` variable is only rendered if it's defined.  This ensures that the component doesn't attempt to access an undefined state variable. Another approach is to use `useEffect` hook to handle any state initialization logic.
